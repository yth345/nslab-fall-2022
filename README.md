| 9/16  | 1. Processed data in MongoDB, convert entries to same data format <br> 2. Plotted daily number of unique servers found from each vantage point|
| 9/23  | Compared the loss of server count when we exclude probes from a country |
| 9/30  | Found the minimum set cover on server IPs by selecting a combination of countries (Greedy, Brute-force) |
| 10/7  | Processed the raw data of channel probes, convert entries to same data format |
| 10/14 | 1. Mapped stream information (language, viewer count) to each probe <br> 2. Cumulated IPs found from a channel in an hour to IPs found from a channel in one day |
| 10/21 | Found the minimum channel cover of edge server IPs in a day |
| 10/28 | Midterm week |
| 11/04 | Tested the performance of a heuristic algorithm (select from highest viewer count) to find IP set cover |
| 11/11 | Looked into the relationship between server IPs and channels. Established a channel selecting criteria for each group of server | 
| 11/18 | Established a channel selecting criteria for each group of server (cont.) | 
| 11/25 | Processed complete data probed from five big countries (US, UK, CA, FR, DE) |
| 12/02 | Got the IP address of each hostname, and recorded the channel information served by an unique IP |
| 12/09 | Summary of the semester |
