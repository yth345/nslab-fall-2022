| 9/16  | 1. Process data in MongoDB, convert entries to same data format <br> 2. Plot daily number of unique servers found from each vantage point|
| 9/23  | Compare the loss of server count when we exclude probes from a country |
| 9/30  | Find the minimum set cover on server IPs by selecting a combination of countries (Greedy, Brute-force) |
| 10/7  | Process the raw data of channel probes, convert entries to same data format |
| 10/14 | 1. Map stream information (language, viewer count) to each probe <br> 2. Cumulate IPs found from a channel in an hour to IPs found from a channel in one day |
| 10/21 | Find the minimum channel cover of edge server IPs in a day (Greedy approximate algorithm and exact algorithm w/ preprocessing)|
